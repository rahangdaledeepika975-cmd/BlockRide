# 🚗 BlockRide

## Project Description
BlockRide is a decentralized ride-sharing platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. It eliminates the need for intermediaries like Uber or Lyft by connecting drivers and riders directly through smart contracts. Payments and ride confirmations are handled securely and transparently on-chain.

---

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a **trustless, fair, and transparent transportation network** where drivers and riders interact directly — reducing commission fees and increasing accessibility worldwide.

---

## Key Features
- 🧍‍♂️ **Ride Creation**: Riders can create ride requests with a specified fare.
- 🚘 **Driver Acceptance**: Drivers can browse and accept available rides.
- 💰 **Secure Payment**: Fare is transferred directly to the driver upon ride completion.
- 🔒 **Transparency**: All transactions are recorded immutably on the blockchain.

---

## Future Scope
- 🛰️ Integrate GPS tracking using decentralized oracles.
- 🪙 Introduce a native token for rewards and governance.
- 📱 Develop a DApp interface for user-friendly booking and tracking.
- 🌍 Expand to multi-chain support for lower gas fees.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Solidity** (Smart Contract)
- **Ethereum / EVM-compatible networks**
- **Hardhat / Truffle** (for development & testing)
- **MetaMask** (for wallet integration)
